# Exercices Python - OpenClassroom

This repository contains all the exercices that I used to treat within the formation  [Apprenez les bases du langage Python] (https://openclassrom.com/fr/courses/6204541-apprenez-les-bases-du-langage-python) about the Python programming language basis by OpenClassrooms 

# Goals

I would like to become a computer science engineer, that's why I started to seek for some formations about programming. Then, I knew about OpenClassrooms which proposes both videos, and written lessons displayed with some concrete exercices, so I decided to start learning, probably the easiest langage nowaydays : Python. 

## Content
